<!--
For our week 7 assignment, we are challenged to choose 3 books on a topic that interests us. The first thing that came to mind were the Dr. Seuss books I read as a child, so we're going to use those. My favorites were:  

Title: "Green Eggs and Ham"  
Authors: Dr. Seuss and James Stevenson (illustrations)  
Pages: 72  
  
Title: "One fish two fish red fish blue fish"  
Authors: Dr. Seuss and James Stevenson (illustrations)  
Pages: 72  
  
"I Am NOT Going to Get up Today!"  
Authors: Dr. Seuss and James Stevenson (illustrations)  
Pages: 48  
  
They are all by the same author, but part of the assignment requested that we choose something with multiple authors, so I'll be including the illustrator James Stevenson as well.

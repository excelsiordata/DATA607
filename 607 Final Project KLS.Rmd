###607 Final Project: OkCupid Analysis  
###By: Kelly Shaffer  

#####The `okc` dataset I'll be using in the analysis contains the profile details from 59,946  
#####individuals active on the online dating site OkCupid as of June 20th, 2012. These individuals  
#####all live within a 25 mile radius of San Francisco, California.  

###I hypothesize the following things:
#####-Smokers are less educated than non-smokers. 
#####-Females are more likely to be vegetarian/vegan than males.  
#####-This population will contain more individuals who identify as something  
#####other than straight than the national average of 3.6%.  
#####-This population is more educated than the national average. 
#####-The males in this population are taller than the females.

####Final Project Checklist items pertaining to the deliverables in this file are listed below  
####for simplicity of grading:  

Your project has a recognizable "data science workflow," such as the OSEMN workflow or Hadley  
Wickham's Grammar of Data Science. [Example: First the data is acquired, then necessary  
transformations and clean-up are performed, then the analysis and presentation work is performed]  

    My project has been organized by Data Acquisition/Import, Data 
    Transformation/Clean Up, and Data Analysis/Visualization.

Project includes data from at least two different types of data sources (e.g., two or more of  
these: relational or CSV, Neo4J, web page [scraped or API], MongoDB, etc.)  

    Data source 1 is a csv file of OkCupid profile data.
    Data source 2 is the "women" dataset from the datasets
    package in R.

Project includes at least one data transformation operation. [Examples: transforming from wide  
to long; converting columns to date format]  

    The following transformations have been performed:
    Renamed all columns.
    Changed -1 to "Rather Not Say" in `Income`
    Extracted date from `Last Login` and created a new column
      `Last Login Date`
        **Converting this to date but getting errors right now
    Created a new column `Data Pull Date` as of 2012-06-20
      **Trying to convert this to date as well
    Created a new column `Days Since Login` which is the difference
      in days between `Last Login Date` and `Data Pull Date`

Project includes at least one statistical analysis and at least one graphics that describes or
validates your data.

    A confidence interval and margin of error was calculated
    for the proportion of females in the population. A bar plot
    displays the proportion.

Project includes at least one graphic that supports your conclusion(s).

    Many graphics are included within the project that support my conclusions.

Project includes at least one statistical analysis that supports your conclusion(s).

    Many analyses have been performed that support my conclusions.

Project includes at least one feature that we did not cover in class! There are many examples:
"I used ggmap; I created a decision tree; I ranked the results; I created my presentation slides
directly from R; I figured out to use OAuth 2.0."

    I'm figuring out how to load data from a zipped file on GitHub.

Presentation. Was the presentation delivered in the allotted time (3 to 5 minutes)?

    I signed up to present early. Therefore, I'll be granted 8 minutes for my presentation.
    I plan to stay within these boundaries.

Presentation. Did you show (at least) one challenge you encountered in code and/or data, and
what you did when you encountered that challenge?

    Challenge: The csv file of data I'm using is too big to upload to GitHub, and
    reproducibility is a requirement of this assignment. If I connect to the data on my local
    machine, I will have not met this requirement.

Code and data. Have you delivered the submitted code and data where it is self-contained
preferably in rpubs.com and github? Am I able to fully reproduce your results with what you've
delivered? You won't receive full credit if your code references data on your local machine!

    I will be uploading all code to rpubs and github. The data is too large to upload to GitHub,
    so I was unable to link to it directly that way. Therefore, I am providing the link to where
    the data can be downloaded and saved to your machine. This should suffice as reproducibility
    since you'll have what you need to recreate my analysis. The link to the data is below:
    https://github.com/rudeboybert/JSE_OkCupid/blob/master/profiles.csv.zip

Code and data. Does all of the delivered code run without errors?

    Yes. All of the delivered code runs without errors. I have commented out a section where I
    tried to link to the zip file on GitHub but couldn't debug the error, despite hours spent
    on stackoverflow.

Code and data. Have you delivered your code and conclusions using a "reproducible research"
tool such as RMarkdown?

    Yes, the file has been delivered in RMarkdown.

#Divide the data into male/female
okc_f <- subset(okc, Gender == "f")
okc_m <- subset(okc, Gender == "m")

#Create the histogram of female heights of okc users

#Look at how normal it really is
qqnorm(okc_f$`Height (in)`)
qqline(okc_f$`Height (in)`)

#Create the histogram of female heights from datasets
data(women)
hist(women$height, main = "Histogram of Female Height", xlab = "Height", breaks = 6)

#Table of aggregated smoker data
Smoke <- table(okc$Smokes)

#Relative frequency table of smoker data
Smoke_Rel <- table(okc$Smokes)/59946
barplot(Smoke)
barplot(Smoke_Rel)

#Comparing gender and smoking
table(okc$Gender, okc$Smokes)/59946
mosaicplot(table(okc$Gender, okc$Smokes), main = "Mosaic Plot of Gender & Smoking")

((25635+18261)/59946)

#Comparing gender and sexual orientation
table(okc$Gender, okc$`Sexual Orientation`)/59946

#Comparing gender and diet
barplot(table(okc$Gender, okc$`Diet`), legend.text = TRUE, args.legend = list(x = "topright", bty = "n"), main = "Stacked Bar Chart of Gender & Diet", xlab = "Diet", ylab = "Frequency")
(table(okc$Gender, okc$`Diet`))

#Male vs. Female Height
#Obviously, we would expect males to be taller in the population
#The same proves true in our sample of okc users
boxplot(okc$`Height (in)` ~ okc$Gender)
histogram(~`Height (in)` | Gender, width=1, layout=c(1,2), xlab="Height in inches", data=okc)

```
The following line of code runs fine in my R Markdown file, but when I try to knit, it produces the following error:

Error:
"Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : could not find function "inference" calls: <Anonymous> ... handle -> withCallingHandler -> withVisible -> eval -> eval"

Code:
ci_gender <- inference(okc$Gender, est = "proportion", type = "ci", method = "theoretical", success = "f")

A screenshot of the output of the function is below for your reference. I have decided to include this analysis in my project despite the error, given the fact that it's not throwing this error when run in R Markdown.

![inference output](http://github.com/excelsiordata/DATA607/blob/master/inference.jpg?raw=true)

Inference Output:
Single proportion -- success: f 
Summary statistics: p_hat = 0.4023 ;  n = 59946 
Check conditions: number of successes = 24117 ; number of failures = 35829 
Standard error = 0.002 
95 % Confidence interval = ( 0.3984 , 0.4062 )

The confidence interval for the proportion of females is (0.3984, 0.4062).

Let's calculate the margin of error for the estimate of the proportion of the proportion of females:

    ME = z* x SE
    ME = 1.96 x 0.002
    ME = 0.00392
    ME = 0.392%

###Conclusions regarding this population:  
####Education  
  41% of users have graduated with their Bachelor's  
  15% of users have graduated with their Master's  
  66.55% have a Bachelor's or greater (including those in school for  
    advanced degrees beyond Bachelor's)  
  Individuals with a college degree are most likely to be non-smokers.  
  
####Smoking  
  Overall, 72% of users do not smoke.  
  42% of male users do not smoke.  
  30% of female users do not smoke.  
    This is really interesting, because in data published by the CDC,  
    less females reporting smoking than males. In the CDC data, it  
    seemed like about half of the population reported smoking, and half  
    reported not smoking. This is much different than what we're seeing  
    here in the San Francisco population, which I believe speaks to the  
    local culture. They are much more environmentally friendly and health  
    conscious in California.  
  Smoking is more common amongst the undereducated.  
    
####Sexual Orientation  
  86% of  users are straight  
  14% of users are not straight  
  
  There are almost three times as many bisexual females than bisexual  
  males.  
    3.3% of users are bisexual females  
    1.2% of users are bisexual males  
  
  There are almost three times as many gay males than gay females.  
    2.6% of users are gay females  
    6.6% of users are gay males  
    
####Body Type  
  "Curvy" is almost exclusively a body type used by females.  
  The body types "Athletic" "Skinny" and "Jacked" are used much more  
  commonly by males to describe themselves.  
  Males are most commonly describing themselves as "Athletic",  
  while females are most commonly describing themselves as "Average".  
  
####Diet  
  This is much more half and half across gender than I thought it  
  would be. I expected that more females would be vegetarian/vegan,  
  but this is not the case. In looking at the mosaic plot of gender  
  and diet, you can see that they look almost the same with just  
  slight variations. A fun surprise to have discovered!

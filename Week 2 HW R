#### Conclusions:

The highest rated movie in our study was "Zootopia", with "Arrival" coming in last.   
     
All of the reviewers' scores seem to be in the same ballpark with the exception of Liam, who has a noticably lower average rating than the other reviewers. Seems he's a bit pickier than the others.
